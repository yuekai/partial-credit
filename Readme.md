# Mini Trainer

MiniTrainer is a small form factor and extremely efficient training library for models up to 70B parameters on a single 8xA100/H100 node, although it supports multinode training if your infrastructure has ROCE/Infiniband.

### Features:
- [Liger Kernels](https://github.com/linkedin/Liger-Kernel/tree/908b89c4dc9bb872351887b382a1e09ca25fbe85) to minimize memory footprint by chunking the loss computation.
- **Automatic minibatching** based on the effective batch size: forget about tuning your gradient accumulation, just specify `max-tokens-per-gpu` and `batch-size` and the library will automatically divides your batches in balanced minibatches across your GPUs while never surpassing the specified number of tokens per GPU.
- **FullyShardedDataParallel** via accelerate for efficient sharding across multi-GPU settings.
- **Padding-free** -- it currently only works on GPUs that support flash attention and uses the padding-free feature of the transformer library to avoid extra computation on padding tokens.
- **Infinite Sampling** -- forget about setting the number of epochs, just start the training and it would automatically sample an infinite stream of batches from your data.
- **pretrain and supervised** fine tuninng tokenization schemes
- **`jsonl` logging**, your metrics will be logged in the output directory as a jsonl that can easily be processed for plotting, wandb or whatever you like for experiment tracking.

# Installation

```shell
conda create -n minitrain python=3.12 -y; conda activate minitrain
pip install torch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Data Tokenization

You first need to tokenize your data and get the input tokens and the output label tokens. The resulting label tokens will contain a mask token (`-100`) for the `user` and `system` roles, and unmask the tokens for the `assistant` role content. If you wish to pretrain (i.e. train on all tokens in the input) include the data in a single `pretrain` role message.

```shell
TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=False \
python process_data.py \
--input-file "data/mistral_pcm_data.jsonl" \
--output-file "data/mistral_pcm_data.tkns.jsonl" \
--model-name-or-path "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct" \
--max-sample-num-tokens 32768
```

### Data Assumptions
The data must be a `json list` format (each line a json), and each sample should have a `messages` field formatted like this:


```json
{"messages": [{"role": "user","content": "<input 1>"},{"role": "assistant","content": "<output 1>"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user","content": "<input 2>"},{"role": "assistant","content": "<output 2>"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "pretrain","content": "<pretrain data>"}]} #this sample will have completely unmasked tokens in the labels.
```

the data processing script will populate `input_ids`, `labels` and the sample length in the `len` keys. To do so the data processor uses the chat template included in the tokenizer, make sure the tokenizer has a proper chat template set up.

NOTE: check the printed examples at the end and make sure the samples look properly formatted and that the masked part of the labels correspods to anything that the model would not learn to generate (although it would still condition the model -- the $x$ in $p(y|x)$ ).

## Pretraining
if you want to pretrain on some samples, such samples should have a messages format with a single element with the role `pretrain` and the data in the `content` key. This would use void using the chat template and the complete string in the `content` key would be unmasked.

## launch training

all training parameters can be found in [train.py](./train.py). Make sure to use the tokenized data created above as the input here.

```shell
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc-per-node=8 train.py \
        --output-dir ./output/ \
        --data-path ./data/mistral_pcm_data.tkns.jsonl \
        --model-name-or-path meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B \
        --min-samples-per-checkpoint 10000 \
        --num-warmup-steps 20 \
        --max-tokens-per-gpu 60000 \
        --batch-size 128 \
        --use-liger-kernels \
        --seed 893 \
        --fsdp-sharding-strategy FULL_SHARD \
        --learning-rate 6e-6
```

the parameters used for the run will be saved in `<output_dir>/training_params.json` and the metrics will be saved to `<output_dir>/training_metrics_0.jsonl`.

NOTE: keep an eye on `nvidia-smi` while training and raise the `max-tokens-per-gpu` until you're close (but not quite to avoid cuda memory re allocations) to the max memory in your GPUs.
