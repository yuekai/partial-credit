"""
This script implements a custom data loading and batching pipeline specifically
designed for efficient distributed training of sequence models, particularly
large language models, on multiple GPUs.

Key Features:
- Infinite Sampler: Provides an endless stream of shuffled data indices,
  suitable for training for a fixed number of steps rather than epochs.
- Initial Batching: Groups samples into initial batches based on a fixed number
  of samples per batch.
- Dynamic Minibatching for Distributed Training: Takes the initial batches and
  further divides them into 'minibatches'. Each minibatch is a list distributed
  across available ranks (GPUs). The allocation process aims to pack sequences
  efficiently such that the total number of tokens processed by any single rank
  within a minibatch step stays below a predefined maximum (`max_tokens_per_gpu`).
  The number of minibatches generated from an initial batch can vary dynamically
  depending on the lengths of the sequences in that batch.
- Token-Based Load Balancing: Ensures that each GPU receives a comparable
  computational load (measured in tokens) per step, optimizing hardware
  utilization and preventing out-of-memory errors when dealing with variable
  sequence lengths.
- Padding/Dummy Samples: Handles cases where ranks might not have enough data
  to fill a minibatch by using dummy samples, ensuring all ranks process the
  same number of minibatches.

    """Distributes indices from a batch into minibatches across ranks.

    Takes a list of sequence lengths corresponding to samples in an initial batch
    and distributes their indices into multiple 'minibatches'. Each minibatch
    represents a step where data is processed concurrently across `num_ranks` GPUs.

    The distribution aims to assign sequences (represented by their indices `sid`
    in the original `batch_lengths` list) to ranks such that the sum of sequence
    lengths (tokens) assigned to any single rank does not exceed
    `max_tokens_per_rank`. It prioritizes assigning the next sequence to the rank
    currently having the minimum total tokens assigned in the current minibatch.

    If adding the next sequence to the least-loaded rank would exceed the limit,
    the current minibatch is considered complete, and a new minibatch is started.

    If the last minibatch is incomplete, ranks with no assigned sequences are
    given a placeholder index of -1.

    Args:
        batch_lengths: A list where each element is the length (number of tokens)
                       of a sequence in the initial batch.
        max_tokens_per_rank: The maximum number of tokens allowed per rank in a
                             single minibatch.
        num_ranks: The total number of distributed training ranks (GPUs).
        rank: The specific rank for which to retrieve the assigned indices.

    Returns:
        A list of lists. Each inner list contains the indices (from the original
        batch) assigned to the specified `rank` for one minibatch. Placeholder -1
        indicates padding.

    The resulting batch format is 'packed' or 'unpadded', where multiple sequences

    by the 'position_ids', which restart from 0 for each concatenated sequence.

    **IMPORTANT**: This format requires the downstream model's attention mechanism
    (e.g., Flash Attention) to correctly handle packed sequences. Standard attention
    implementations may not work correctly as they expect padded inputs and explicit
    attention masks. Flash Attention typically uses mechanisms like `cu_seqlens`
